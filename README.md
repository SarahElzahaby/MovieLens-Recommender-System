# End-to-End Recommendation System for the MovieLens (small) Dataset!

This project is the development of a comprehensive recommender system using two advanced approaches:

## Approaches

### User-Based Recommendations using Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)
Employs neural networks to model complex user-item interactions, providing accurate and personalized recommendations.

### Movie-Based Recommendations using Cosine Similarity
Suggests movies similar to those a user has enjoyed, based on ratings and genres.

## Features of The Dashboard Built with Dash

### Movie Lover Page
- **Personal Watching History**: Displays the userâ€™s movie-watching history.
- **Custom Movie Recommendations**: Allows users to specify the number of recommendations and view posters of top-rated movies tailored to their preferences.

### Movie Itself Page
- **Title-Based Recommendations**: Provides recommendations based on the selected movie title, using ratings and genre similarity.
